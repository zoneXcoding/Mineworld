/**
 * Interface common to all assets.
 *
 * An asset is some data that is used by the game - a texture, sound, block definition and the like. These are typically
 * loaded from a module, although they can also be created at runtime. Each asset is identified by a URI that uniquely
 * identifies it and can be used to obtain it. This uri provides a lightweight way to serialize a reference to an Asset.
